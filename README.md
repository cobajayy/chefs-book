<h1>Welcome to Chef's Book! </h1>

<h3>Your Recipes in one place! </h3>
<br></br>
<p>Goal: My goal was to create a digital recipe book where you can find your favorite recipes instructions all in one place. I wanted to create a place where you and adjust pantry items to know what you needed to buy for each recipe. </p>

<p>Technologies: My main technology used was Python, Django, PostgeSQL, CSS, HTML, GitHub. 
</p>
<p>Next steps: 
    <ul>
        <li>Styling-details: I want to create a more aesthetic dropdown bar when adding new or editing.
        </li>
        <li>
        I want to create list filters to organize the recipes and pantry items base off their kind (ie: all Latin cusines or protiens: shrimp, chicken, tofu)
        </li>
        <li>
        I want to create list filters to choose specific cuisines within the main cuisine (ie European then dropdown and choose between Italian, Spanish, French, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
        I want to create a grocery portion that the user can verify whether they have the pantry ingredients needed and then add them to the grocery list. 
        </li>
        <li>
        I want to create a community page to view and share others recipes.
        </li>
        <li>I want to render an image based off the cuisine instead of the dinner plate for them all.
        </li>
    </ul>
